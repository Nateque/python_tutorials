# Inheritance - it allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# abstraction - break things in small parts
# encapsulation - hiding implementation (code details)
# polymorphism - ability to take various forms (alag alag roop dharan karna) - we can achieve by overriding, dunder methods
