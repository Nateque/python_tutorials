"""Difference between List and Array"""

"""
Array of C, C++ and java - stores only one datatype like int, string, etc
python list - flexible, you can store multiple datatypes

python also have array module but we dont use it
instead we use numpy array in data science (because it has binding with c libraries)

javascript array is same like python list / flexible
