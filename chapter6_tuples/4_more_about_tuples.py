# Something more about tuples

# you can create tuple using range as well

num = tuple(range(1,11))
# print(num)
# print(type(num))

# you can change tuples into list or string as well

num_list = list((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10))
# print(num_list)

nums = str((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10))
# print(type(nums))
