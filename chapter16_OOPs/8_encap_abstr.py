# Definition of encapsulation According to Wikipedia is  
# In object oriented programming languages, encapsulation is used to refer to 
# one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof:

# A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
# A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) 
# operating on that data.


# Note :- In python everything is public so you can access anything directly but 
# you can do name mangling(putting double underscore in front of variable name , this concept  in this chapter) 
# which will internally change the name of your variable or method and some how you will be able to manage to control direct access.

# _name = indicates private method(but in pythond everything is public)
# __name__ = dunder/magic method
